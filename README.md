Breast Cancer Classification Model

Overview:
This repository contains a machine learning model developed to classify breast cancer into malignant and benign tumors. Breast cancer is a critical area of medical research, and accurate classification can aid in early detection and treatment.

Key Features:
- Utilizes a machine learning model, such as a support vector machine (SVM), to perform classification.
- Built using Python and popular data science libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, matplotlib and scikit-learn.
- Provides detailed documentation and Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
- Allows for easy reproduction of results and model deployment in various environments.

Dataset:
The model is trained on the widely recognized Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset, which contains features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The dataset is available through the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Usage:
This model can be used to assist medical professionals in classifying breast cancer tumors. It is suitable for educational purposes, research, and as a starting point for more complex diagnostic systems.

Getting Started:
- Clone or download the repository.
- Review the Jupyter notebooks for comprehensive insights into data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.
- Use the trained model for classification tasks in your own projects.

Contributions:
Contributions, issues, and feature requests are welcome. Feel free to submit pull requests and help improve the model's performance or extend its capabilities.
